#Data Source
The dataset was gotten from entrylevel.net and it contains two tables ‘donation data’ and ‘donors data’. When merged together, they contain 1000 records and 15 attributes. The dataset contains information of registered donors, information such as state, id, first name, last name, emails, gender, job field, donor’s state, donations, and donation frequency. Other additional information about the donors are in the ‘donors data’ dataset.
